# Introduction  
The web application aims to bridge the gap between donors and those who in need. Donations can 
include used items, money, services, blood, or even human organs. The platform provides a 
trustworthy environment where donors can securely contribute, and knowing their donations will 
not reach to wrong hands.  
For those who in need, the platform provides a reliable source to meet their urgent requirements. 
While they may depend on others’ help, they still wish to maintain their dignity and live like 
everyone else. The platform ensures this by keeping their personal information confidential, sharing 
it only with the necessary parties.  
  
  
  
# Motivation  
There are many motivations derived us to implement this platform. There are plenty of donors who 
are generous to donate their wealth for advancement of the society, but the lack of reliable platform 
to identify real needs and genuine needy people holds them back doing their charity work. Our 
platform will encourage them to do their charity work without any hesitation, because the platform 
will provide security, curating and fame if donor desire. Furthermore, there are plenty of needy 
people who are reluctant to ask from others, even though they are in a desperate situation. This 
platform will provide them with peace of mind. On the other hand, the platform will track potential 
beggars who is always trying to gain benefits from others without doing hard work and discourage 
them from asking again and again. The platform itself discourage donors to giving out to them by 
lowering their rating.  
  

## Problem Statement and Project Objectives  
# Problem Statement  
In today's society, there is a significant gap between potential donors and individuals in need. Many 
generous donors are willing to contribute money, used items, services, blood, or human organs for 
charitable causes, but they often lack reliable, trustworthy platforms to ensure their donations reach 
the right hands. On the other hand, needy individuals, despite their desperate situations, often feel 
reluctant to seek help due to concerns about privacy and pride. They require a platform where their 
personal information is protected, and their dignity is maintained. Additionally, there is a need to 
identify and discourage individuals who exploit charitable systems for personal gain without 
genuine need, ensuring resources are directed to those truly in need.

information. Only people who are allowed should have access to keep their dignity 
intact.

regular updates and be accountable to boost donor confidence.

# Introduction to Similar Types of Systems  
1. Crowdfunding Platforms:  
• Websites like Kickstarter, GoFundMe, and Indiegogo allow individuals to raise 
funds for various causes, projects, or personal needs.  
• Donors contribute money, and recipients share their stories to attract support.  
• These platforms often provide transparency by showing progress, updates, and how 
funds are used.   
2. Food Banks and Distribution Networks:  
• Organizations like food banks collect surplus food from donors (individuals, 
businesses, or farms) and distribute it to those in need.  
• They ensure efficient allocation of resources, preventing waste and addressing 
hunger.    
3. Blood Donation Systems:  
• Blood banks and donation centres collect blood from voluntary donors.  
• The blood is then distributed to hospitals for medical treatments.  
• These systems prioritize safety, traceability, and equitable distribution.    
4. Organ Transplant Networks:  
• Networks connect organ donors (living or deceased) with recipients in need of 
transplants.  
• Rigorous protocols ensure fairness, confidentiality, and timely allocation.    
5. Community-Based Mutual Aid Networks:  
• Grassroots initiatives where community members support each other.  
• Examples include neighbourhood groups, mutual aid societies, and local charity 
drives.  
  
 
# Conclusion 
Creating a secure and reliable platform for donors and recipients is a noble endeavour. By 
leveraging Java and Spring Boot for the backend, you’ll have a robust foundation. For the 
front end, consider Vue.js or React to ensure an accessible and user-friendly experience. 
Remember to involve stakeholders throughout the process and iterate based on real-world 
usage.
